    <title>Managing Recurring Order Account Details</title>

<p>It has come to our attention that it is difficult to alter existing Recurring Orders.  Alterations are required when customers are leaving on vacation, want to change the number or type of coffee they are ordering, or simply need to update credit card expiry dates. </p>
<p>The very first thing you need to do is LOGIN to your STORE ACCOUNT by clicking <strong>LOGIN at the TOP RIGHT</strong> of the Home Page and enter your details.</p>
<p>In order to make altering Recurring Order details MUCH easier, I've added a link at the <strong>BOTTOM RIGHT in the FOOTER</strong> of every page on our website called "<strong>Manage Recurring Orders</strong>".</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/6846/files/Screen_Shot_2019-01-21_at_1.27.29_PM_large.png?v=1548095289" alt=""></p>
<p>When you click on this link you will be taken to your Recurring Orders Management Page where you can click on the <strong>BLUE</strong> links.  On the right hand side of the page is one that indicates <strong>MANAGE</strong>, where you can update or alter any aspect of your recurring orders.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0286/6846/files/Screen_Shot_2019-01-21_at_1.26.57_PM_large.png?v=1548095309" alt=""></p>
<p>NOTE:  When logging into your STORE ACCOUNT first, you can access the Recurring Orders and the Loyalty Rewards Apps.  The RECURRING ORDERS link is at the top left of every page, and the LOYALTY REWARDS widget link is dead centre at the bottom of the every page.</p>
<p>I hope this is a helpful addition to the website and makes some of the annoying things about e-commerce vanish.</p>]]>
